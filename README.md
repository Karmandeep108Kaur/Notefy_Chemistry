Chemistry notes on Degree of Hardness 

## Degree of Hardness of Water

1. Degree of hardness is defined as the number of parts of calcium carbonate or equivalent to various calcium and magnesium salts present in a million parts of water by mass.
The more calcium and magnesium the water contains, the harder the water. 
2. Water hardness is usually expressed in milligrams per litre (mg/L) or in ppm (parts per million).
3. Degree of Hardness = (The weight of hardness causing salts × 100 (Molecular weight of CaCO3)) / Molecular weight of hardness causing salts.

## Calcium Carbonate is considered as a standard for calculating hardness

1. Its molecular weight (100) and equivalent weight (50) is a whole number, so the calculations in water analysis can be simplified. 
2. It is the most insoluble salt that can be precipitated in water treatment.

## Numericals on Degree of Hardness of Water 

### Problem-1:
A sample of water is found to contains following dissolving salts in milligrams per litre 
Mg(HCO3)2 = 73, CaCl2 = 111, Ca(HCO3)2 = 81, MgSO4 = 40 and MgCl2 = 95. Calculate temporary and 
permanent hardness and total hardness.

### Solution: 

| Name of the hardness causing salts | Amount of the hardness causing salts(mg/Lit) | Molecular weight of hardness causing salts | Amounts equivalent to CaCO3 (mg/Lit) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mg(HCO3)_2 | 73 | 146 | 73×100/146=50 |
| CaCl_2 | 111 | 111 | 111×100/111 = 100 |
| Ca(HCO3)_2 | 81 | 162 | 81×100/162 = 50 |
| MgSO_4 | 40 | 120 | 40×100/120 = 33.3 |
| MgCl_2 | 95 | 95 | 95×100/95 = 100 |

Temporary hardness = Mg(HCO3)2 + Ca(HCO3)_2
                   = 50 + 50 = 100mgs/Lit.
Permanent hardness = CaCl_2 + MgSO_4 + MgCl_2
                   = 100 + 33.3 + 100 = 233.3 mgs/Lit.
Total hardness = Temporary hardness + Permanent hardness
                   = 100 + 233.3 = 333.3 mgs/Lit.


### Problem-2:
A sample of water is found to contains following dissolving salts in milligrams per litre 
Mg(HCO3)2 = 16.8, MgCl2 = 12.0, MgSO4 = 29.6 and NaCl = 5.0. Calculate temporary and permanent hardness of water.

### Solution:

| Name of the hardness causing salts | Amount of the hardness causing salts(mg/Lit) | Molecular weight of hardness causing salts | Amounts equivalent to CaCO3 (mg/Lit) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mg(HCO3)_2 | 16.8 | 146 | 16.8×100/146 = 11.50 |
| MgCl_2 | 12.0 | 95 | 12.0×100/95 = 12.63 |
| MgSO_4 | 29.6 | 120 | 29.6×100/120 = 24.66 |
| NaCl | 5.0 | NaCl does not contribute any hardness to water hence it is ignored. |

Temporary hardness = Mg(HCO3)2 
                   = 11.50 mgs/Lit.
 Permanent hardness = MgCl2 + MgSO4 
                    = 12.63 + 24.66
                    = 37.29 mgs/Lit.
